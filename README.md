This project focuses on the development and implementation of an Internet of Things 
(IoT) device designed to monitor structural parameters of network base stations, 
often located in remote and hard-to-reach areas. The device was developed during 
Aalto Universityâ€™s Protopaja course with the aim is to digitize and automate the 
monitoring and analysis of various structures, products, and services. The primary 
objective was to create an energy-efficient, long-lasting IoT device capable of 
measuring the structural conditions of the station towers and display the collected, 
clean data to the user. 
 

Utilizing wireless sensor stations, the device aims to capture real-time data and transmit it 
to a microprocessor via Bluetooth. Data is then sent to a cloud-based server via a 
mobile network, where it is processed, stored, and displayed through a user 
interface. This allows for real-time statistical display, anomaly detection, and 
predictive maintenance alerts.
